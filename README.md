CHIPInstaller has been created by [Damian Vila](https://github.com/damianvila) - [Iker Garcia](https://github.com/IkerGarcia) - [Robert Wolterman](https://github.com/xtacocorex) and [Mathias Thur](github.com/AllGray). 		
 		
**Motivation** 		
		
C.H.I.P is an amazing Linux handheld machine. It allows, and will allow more in the future, several uses. However, in order to install the software a heavy use of terminal is needed and this can be awful for user with less experience. Damian Vila and Iker Garc√≠a had previously teamed up to develop [PocketInstaller](https://github.com/IkerGarcia/PocketInstaller). Mathias Thur had been working on several scripts to install different tools like Guacamole, Ownlcoud... we all teamed up and developed CHIPinstaller. Then, Robert Wolterman, joined us as a really valuable team member.		
 		
**Contributors** 		
		
Everyone can contribute to this project, improve the code and add functions. If anyone wants something to be added to the installer we will try to do it. Also, .sh files and config files are always welcome, so we just need to add the pushed software to the main GUI. As this is being updated regularly, don't forget to rebase your fork before creating a pull-request.
